This is the full project. I've created an .exe files from it which works in standalone mode under Windows. You need to download only the two .rar files.

Could use containerization (I’ve run into Python dependency hell) and currently displays only the first price on a given day (yeah, I should’ve thought about multiple flights on the same day).
Regardless, this is still very useful. Enjoy!
(Had to split into two chunks due to GitHub's size restriction.)
